        <h1>Killer mountain</h1>
        <h2>Dangerous mountain</h2> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

        <p>
             Although the summit of Everest is at a higher altitude, 
             K2 is a more difficult and dangerous climb, due in part to
             its more northern location, where inclement weather is more common.
             The summit was reached for the first time by the Italian climbers
             Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni, on the 1954 Italian expedition led by Ardito Desio.
              As of February 2021, 377 people have summited K2. There have been 91 deaths during attempted climbs. <br> <br>

             The name K2 is derived from the notation used by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of British India.
             Thomas Montgomerie made the first survey of the Karakoram from Mount Haramukh, some 210 km (130 mi) to the south
             and sketched the two most prominent peaks, labelling them K1 and K2, where the K stands for Karakoram.
